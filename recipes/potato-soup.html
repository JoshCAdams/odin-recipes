    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This best tasting potato soup is perfect for when the weather is bad or
      good. Simple to prepare, but tastes like you've slaved away. Excellent by
      itself or with crackers and other favorite additions. So when you're
      snowed in, make up a batch and call the family around to enjoy! Thanks
      Mary Ella!

      <li>
        In a large pot over medium heat, cook the bacon until evenly brown, but
        not crisp. Mix in the onion, and coat with the bacon drippings. Stir in
        potatoes, and season with salt and pepper. Mix in the flour and water,
        stirring until smooth. Cover pot, and cook 10 minutes, until potatoes
        are tender.

      <li>
        Reduce heat to low. Gradually stir in the milk. Simmer soup 1 hour,
        stirring frequently to avoid scorching.
